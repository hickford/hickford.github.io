This year I competed again in Google Code Jam, a mathematics and algorithms competition. I finished ranking 930, winning a t-shirt. Thanks Google!

This was my favourite problem to solve <http://code.google.com/codejam/contest/dashboard?c=1150486#s=p2>

Here are my solutions <https://github.com/matt-hickford/codejam>

Here's an extract from [my solution](https://github.com/matt-hickford/codejam/blob/master/2011/0/bots/bots.py
) for the problem [Bot Trust](http://code.google.com/codejam/contest/dashboard?c=975485#)

{% highlight python linesnos=table %}

for i in range(1,T+1):
    freesince = dict(O=0,B=0)
    position = dict(O=1,B=1)
    line = deque(f.readline().split())
    N = int(line.popleft())
    
    clock = 0
    
    while line:
        bot, target = line.popleft(), int(line.popleft())
        d = abs(target-position[bot])
        
        # move
        clock += max(0, d - (clock - freesince[bot]) )
        position[bot] = target

        # push button
        clock += 1
        freesince[bot] = clock
        
    print "Case #%d: %s" % (i,clock)
    
{% endhighlight %}
