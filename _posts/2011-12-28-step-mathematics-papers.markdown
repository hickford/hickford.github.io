STEP Mathematics is an examination paper in the UK. Cambridge University uses it as an admissions test. The best way to prepare for an examination is to practise. When I took the paper in 2007 the past papers were expensive to acquire. Since then, the exam board [Cambridge Assessment](http://www.admissionstests.cambridgeassessment.org.uk/adt/step) have published the past papers freely. This is a Good Thing for Access. 

It happens that the exam board have published the past papers inside [zip archives](http://www.admissionstests.cambridgeassessment.org.uk/adt/step/Test+Preparation). This makes them inaccessible to search engines.

For posperity, I've republished the papers at document publishing website Scribd: [STEP Mathematics past papers 1998-2011](http://www.scribd.com/hmphry/documents). Since the exam board have already published the papers freely I have no qualms about copyright.

Another reason I did this—I want to write a post about a question I remember answering. If k people are in the room, what is the probability p that at least two of them share a birthday? What is the least k such that p is at least one half?

Alas, the copies of the papers for the years 2004, 2005 and 2007 are scans rather than machine-readable originals. I shall email Cambridge Assessment about this.

Suggestions for anywhere I could reliably publish documents for 10+ years are welcome.
