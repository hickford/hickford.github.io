STEP Mathematics is a set of examinations in the UK. Cambridge University uses it as an admissions test. The best way to prepare for an examination is to practise, but when I took the paper in 2007 you had to get copies of past papers. Since then, the exam board [Cambridge Assessment](http://www.admissionstests.cambridgeassessment.org.uk/adt/step) have published the past papers freely on the web. This is a good thing for fair admissions. 

However it happens that the exam board have published the past papers inside [zip archives](http://www.admissionstests.cambridgeassessment.org.uk/adt/step/Test+Preparation). This makes it hard to find specific questions using a search engine. The web site also keep changing its urls!

For posperity, I've republished the papers at document publishing website Scribd: [STEP Mathematics past papers 1998-2011](http://www.scribd.com/hmphry/documents). Since the exam board have already published the papers online, this seems fair use.

One memorable problem, that I'd like to write a post about.

> If k people are in the room, what is the probability p that at least two of them share a birthday? What is the least k such that p is at least one half?
